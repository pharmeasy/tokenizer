# this file is for reference purposes, changing anything here will not change the base image
# This is the base image used for the first stage build for docker
#
# Why is it not part of the primary Dockerfile?
# The image was prebuilt and fetched from ECR as it requires http based packages from debian
# which was insecure and not allowed by the firewall. You will find this image pre built and stored
# in the ECR location of every environment
# 
# How is the image added during the deployment process?
# Jenkins cofigurations include a sed command that adds a line to the dockerfile
# which then fetches this pre built image from the ECR
#
# How do i build the project locally? 
# to build the project locally, add this to the main dockerfile
# since the access to the ECR image is not permitted on local machines
# 
# Steps to update the base image
# after you make changes here, you have to rebuild the base image, store it in ECR (devops does this)
# update jenkins configs to point to the new ECR (you need to change this for all instances)
